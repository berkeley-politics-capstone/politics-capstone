      "If you say so. I get the amendment king thing, its just that for a guy whos been in Congress for 3 decades, I just don't see much in the way of effective leadership either in the past or recently. And if polls are any indication right now, there are a few yellow flags for the movement behind him. Not yet big enough to be red flags, but definitely a little worrisome. Again, if I had seen a lot more concrete evidence of a strong progressive movement on a national scale during the midterms, I'd be more inclined to believe you. But as things stand...ehhhh. I think you might be over estimating the movement hes created. {'neg': 0.027, 'neu': 0.865, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.8569}\n",

      "I don't think he should have been expected to be a great congressional leader, with him being ostracized from the rest of the party and being from a very small state and being fringe in terms of the congressional Overton window. But he went beyond those low expectations and spoke out and voted and led on important policies and ideas: Against DOMA, for 90s healthcare reform, against the Iraq War, against the Fed and Alan Greenspan in the 2000s, etc. I just don't think you're not really paying attention and haven't paid attention to what hes done.  As for polls, polls are generally meaningless a year out from the actual primary. But hes shown that he can last through primaries (as opposed to Biden, who can't), and he already has campaign infrastructure and support (email lists, small donors) built up. If he was able to almost beat Hillary god-damn Clinton, he can beat whatever no-name the Establishment throws at him.  As for the midterms, I agree to an extent that anti-establishment progressives didn't get as much headway as we may have wanted. But there was a lot of progress, so frankly I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just means we have to work a little harder.  {'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.8545}\n",
      "Thats debatable.  But the DNC admitted in court that the primary process is not democratic, and that they can pick whoever they want, from cigar filled backrooms. There is little point running in the Democratic Primary, it isn't a real election.  Running as an independent guarantees a spot in general, and will severely shake up the political system. As long as either a Democrat or a Republican wins, the system for the rich is safe. Thats why the MSM spreads the myth about the \"spoiler vote\".  They're afraid of third parties and independents.  {'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.154, 'compound': 0.872}\n",
      "At this point I feel like we're really just talking in circles here. I just think that a lack of demonstrated confessional leadership, a less than ideal movement behind him, signs of waning interest in him as a candidate, a semi-fraught relationship with the party he'd lead, and a lack of political finesse all add up to a candidate who is just very questionable. And we haven't even gotten into policy. I just don't see it. {'neg': 0.09, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.144, 'compound': 0.6403}\n"
