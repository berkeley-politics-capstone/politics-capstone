      "What I particularly liked about this article was that it showed how Beto approaches the role of being an elected official who represents a constituency.  The writer asked (in 2013, now) about Congresss calls for border enforcement. Beto gives a three-part response:   Identifying that issue within its broader context, and refusing to placate by using a catch phrase with little meaning just so you can be heard saying the \"right\" things;   Providing specific examples of how the issue is affecting his constituents;   Acknowledging that to make a change that is good for his constituents, he will also need to identify \"whats in it for them\" for his counterparts who are working for other constituents, so that there can be real action that works for everyone.  Thats the way its supposed to work. And that not enough of our elected officials are doing that is the reason people say that our government is broken, we need some nebulously-defined \"outsider\", etc. We know somethings not working, but we're not putting our finger on what exactly isn't working. Its this approach thats missing. {'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.941, 'pos': 0.022, 'compound': -0.4026}\n",
      "Thats the best they had against Clinton and she wasn't fine. ​ Remember this meme that claimed her largest donors were Banks?  Dude, check out the biggest employers in New York: ​ https://moneyinc.com/the-20-biggest-employers-in-nyc/ ​ The 20 Biggest Employers in NYC 1. JPMorgan Chase & Co/249,257 employees 2. Citi/219,000 employees ​ So what that meme is showing you is that over a two decade period including 2 senate runs and 2 presidential primaries the people who worked for the two largest employers in her state gave her an amount of money that is less than a seventh of a percent of her total war chest.  Tellers, janitors, Security guards, ATM repairmen, HR people, secretaries, IT staff  ...  you know, normal people. ​ If you hate her for those donations you are essentially saying that almost half a million human beings don't get to donate to candidates they like because of who they work for.  This board looks exactly like my posts in 2016 pointing out exactly these same points about Clinton.  Yes its a stupid mean lying attack.

      " (which no candidate is doing but I've seen a lot of writers do it). ​ Bernie argued that Obama needed to be primaried in 2012. ​ https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/176737-sanders-says-he-doesnt-know-who-would-step-up-to-primary-obama ​ Sanders said he still supports the concept of a primary challenge for Obama, because, Sanders said, even Republicans have done a better job of keeping their campaign promises than Obama.  ​ How is that not calling Obama a failure?   ​ Sanders has a consistent pattern of demanding that other people be judged on what they haven't achieved while he himself may only be judged on his intentions.  When he fails then the story must be the insurmountable obstacles in his way.  But when anyone else fails it is because they are corrupt, incompetent, or secret republicans who don't really want to succeed in the first place.   And of course everyone elses accomplishments may not be mentioned at all.  It doesn't matter that Bill Clinton, for example, stopped military investigations into soldiers sex lives and dishonorable discharges for gay service members.  It doesn't matter that thanks to him retired gay soldiers could become political activists for LGBT rights without losing their benefits or pension or GI Bill.  It doesn't matter that ex-soldier activists were fundamental in changing public sentiments and perceptions of gay men and paved the way for future progress.  In Bernie-land all we are allowed to talk about was that Bill wasn't able to get the votes he needed to pass the open service he campaigned on.  What a failure! ​ {'neg': 0.127, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.108, 'compound': -0.1131}\n",

      " and virtually all of the actual Sanders supporters in 2016 voted for Clinton in the end. ​ 1 in 4 Bernie primary voters did not vote for Clinton.  They did have lower pure defection rates than usual - 2% fewer of them went all the way and voted Trump, but they had historically unimaginably high rates of voting third party, writing in Bernie, or sitting at home and not voting at all.  In 2008 the Green party got about 160 thousand votes.  In 2016 it was 1.4 MILLION votes (reminder, Trump is president because of a mere 70K votes).  They haven't seen numbers like this since Ralph Nader gifted us with Bush the younger.   ​ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_the_United_States#President_and_Vice_President ​ Yeah I know, Bernie wasn't paying the bucks for the media campaigns that encouraged people to do this.  We know from the Mueller investigation that it was Russia shilling for Bernie with armies of bots and trolls. But those bots and trolls worked to influence peoples behavior because they amplified Bernies own messaging and also because he didn't lift a finger to fight back - even though he admits he knew it was happening and claims he told Hillarys campaign about it - apparently he thinks she should have done more to stop it while he bore no responsibility to say anything. This is patently ludicrous because the target of such a smear campaign is always the least credible person to call it out.  The most credible person is the beneficiary which is why this all could have been stopped cold if Bernie had been willing to sound the alarm in 2016.   ​ Bernie will let himself be used by right wing propaganda against Beto, Biden, or whoever the same way he let himself be used against Clinton.
