title:  "Media Coverage and the 2020 Democratic Primary"
---

Everybody want's to know who will win the 2020 Deomocratic Primary. Our team at Berkeley is here to review some of the storylines so far in the race, and give our impressions on where the race might be headed.


### How To Measure Support

Our curated 2020 primary dataset contains 5 variables that could be used to measure the hype surrounding a candidate. We included: a nationwide polling average, a count of individual donations, a sum of individual donations, a count of small donations, and a count of candidate mentions on cable TV. Additionally we looked at each variable in two ways - first as a raw measurement and second as a normalized score relative to the field of candidates. There's a case for any one of these measurements (or a combination thereof) to be used as a measurement for how a candidate is doing. In fact all of those numbers are reported on regularly during the primary. However our research led us to polling as the best outcome variable at this point in the primary. 

Donation derived variables, especially in the early stages of a race, are largely explained by each campaign's fundraising effort. For example, donnation drives ususally include direct emails to supporters and digital advertising. This inflates donor count numbers for a week or so at a time in a way that is completely uncorrelated with the news cycle. Another example is bundling, which generates large sums of money on a single day by bringing together high net-worth donors for a meet-and-greet that usually includes the maximum allowable donation to the campaing. Therefore using donations as a proxy for hype was ineffective, since the outcome was not correlated with our measurements of the media cycle.

TV mentions presented a different challenge, in that they were easily measured by our nlp features because they measured the same underlying effect. That is, cable TV mentions were a proxy for hype within the media ecosystem, but not necessarily a good measure of hype amoung voters.

Polling turned out to be the best measure of candidate support. Polling has many desireable characteristics: it changes slowly, it's measured frequently, and they are professional organizations curating the data. Additionally there is [existing research](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/) that supports polls as the best measurement of the eventual winner of the campaign, with the caveat that they are not perfectly predictive. But for our purposes they work well enough to measure day-to-day changes in the excitement around candidates.

### Measuring Candidates Individually

In modeling polling as a function of topics from the media ecosystem.

### Joe Biden

Joe Biden entered the race in mid-April, giving us only 11 weeks of data on his campaign. However unlike the other candidates, his polling has been pretty stable over that time period, staying between 30% and 40% support.

### Elizabeth Warren

Elizabeth Warren exemplifies what we were hoping to find in our model. We explained 87% of the varriation in her poll numbers using just four of our media topic features. Additionally, Warren demonstrated an effect we suspected was playing a major role in this primary - identity politics. When Elizabeth Warren is mentioned in the media in association with her identity characteristics: Massachusetts, Senator, Professor, Harvard, Woman - she tends to rise in the polls. Even more interesting, one of her signature policies, earasing student loan debt, has a negative impact on her polling. This demonstrates that voters are interested in WHO the candidates are but not necessarily WHAT they stand for.

### Kamala Harris

Even more than Senator Warren, Senator Kamala Harris's campaign is driven by an identity narrative. When she is mentioned with her identity features: Black, Senator, Prosecutor, California, and Woman, she sees a positive effect in the polls. The same goes for when she is mentioned alongside AOC, Cory Booker, and other Congress Men and Women of color. He only negative effects are when she is associated with impeaching President Trump. The negative effect of being mentioned alongside Pete Buttigeig is most likely not a causal relation, but rather that her polls (along with other candidates) dipped during the "Buttigieg Bump" in March and April.
