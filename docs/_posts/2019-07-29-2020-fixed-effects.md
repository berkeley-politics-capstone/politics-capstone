title:  "Media Coverage and the 2020 Democratic Primary"
---

Everybody want's to know who will win the 2020 Deomocratic Primary. Our team at Berkeley is here to review some of the storylines so far in the race, and give our impressions on where the race might be headed.


### How To Measure Support

Our curated 2020 primary dataset contains 5 variables that could be used to measure the hype surrounding a candidate. We included: a nationwide polling average, a count of individual donations, a sum of individual donations, a count of small donations, and a count of candidate mentions on cable TV. Additionally we looked at each variable in two ways - first as a raw measurement and second as a normalized score relative to the field of candidates. There's a case for any one of these measurements (or a combination thereof) to be used as a measurement for how a candidate is doing. In fact all of those numbers are reported on regularly during the primary. However our research led us to polling as the best outcome variable at this point in the primary. 



### Measuring Candidates Individually

### Joe Biden

Joe Biden entered the race in mid-April, giving us only 11 weeks of data on his campaign. However unlike the other candidates, his polling has been pretty stable over that time period, staying between 30% and 40% support.
