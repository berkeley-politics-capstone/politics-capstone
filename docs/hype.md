# Measuring Hype

#### Understanding the 2020 campaign requires analyzing multiple different sources of information in order to create a holistic view of this election. Our team has worked to identify and gather the data that will allow us to understand the hype surrounding a candidate.
<br/>

**Donations** <br/>
Tracking donations provided to a candidates campaign allows us to see more than just a total amount of money raised. It allows us to understand the frequency of small donations by individuals, which could mean increased hype surrounding that candidate. <br/>

<br/>

**Media Coverage** <br/>
News outlets are a major source of information for Americans looking to understand more about the election. Summarizing this data, we look to understand which candidates are receiving the most news coverage across all major networks and which may be trending in the right direction. <br/>

<br/>

**Polling** <br/>
Polls allow us to get an understanding of where candidates rank relative to each other based off a sample of the American population. While polls may change drastically over time, we can still combine our understanding of polls with our other data sources to better evaluate candidate hype. <br/>
