# Measuring Hype

Understanding the 2020 campaign requires analyzing multiple different sources of information in order to create a holistic view of this election. Our team has worked to identify and gather the data that will allow us to understand the hype surrounding a candidate. <br/>
<br/>

**Donations** <br/>
Tracking donations provided to a candidates campaign allows us to see more than just a total amount of money raised. It allows us to understand the frequency of small donations by individuals, which could mean increased hype surrounding that candidate. <br/>
Data provided by Federal Election Commission ([FEC](https://www.fec.gov/))
