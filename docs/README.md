# About This Project

This is a capstone project for the [Berkeley MIDS](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/academics/) program. Our focus is to analyze the feedback loops between the media and political campaigns with a particular focus on the 2020 United States presidential election. We have a particular interest in [cable news](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/cable-news-is-covering-biden-as-much-as-every-other-democratic-candidate-combined/) and [campaign donations](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-fundraising/).

This capstone project runs from May through August of 2019, and we will be posting updates about our progress on this website.
